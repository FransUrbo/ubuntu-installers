 <title>Preparing Files for USB Memory Stick Booting</title>

<para>

For preparing the USB stick you will need a system where GNU/Linux is
already running and where USB is supported. You should ensure that the
usb-storage kernel module is loaded (<userinput>modprobe
usb-storage</userinput>) and try to find out which SCSI device the USB
stick has been mapped to (in this example
<filename>/dev/sda</filename> is used). To write to your stick, you
will probably have to turn off its write protection switch.

</para><para>

Note that the USB stick should be at least 32 MB in size. If you follow
<xref linkend="usb-copy-flexible"/> and want to include an Ubuntu ISO
image on the stick, you will need enough space for the ISO as well.

</para>

  <sect2 id="usb-copy-easy">
  <title>Copying the files - the easy way</title>
<para>

There is an all-in-one file <filename>netboot/boot.img.gz</filename>
which contains all the installer files (including the kernel) as well
as <command>SYSLINUX</command> and its configuration file. You only
have to extract it directly to to your USB stick:

<informalexample><screen>

gzip -dc boot.img.gz >/dev/<replaceable>sda</replaceable>

</screen></informalexample>

Of course this will destroy anything already on the device, so take
care that you use the correct device name for your USB stick.

</para>

  <title>Copying the files - the flexible way</title>
<para>

If you like more flexibility or just want to know what's going on, you
should use the following method to put the files on your stick. We
will show how to setup the memory stick to use the first partition,
instead of entire device.

</para><note><para>

Since most USB sticks come pre-configured with a single FAT16
partition, you probably won't have to repartition or reformat the
stick.  If you have to do that anyway, use <command>cfdisk</command>
or any other partitioning tool for creating a FAT16 partition and then
type

<informalexample><screen>

mkdosfs /dev/<replaceable>sda1</replaceable>

</screen></informalexample>

Take care that you use the correct device name for your USB stick. The
<command>mkdosfs</command> command is contained in the
<classname>dosfstools</classname> Debian package.

</para></note><para>

In order to start the kernel after booting from the USB stick, we will
put a boot loader on the stick. Although any boot loader
(e.g. <command>LILO</command>) should work, it's convenient to use
<command>SYSLINUX</command>, since it uses a FAT16 partition and can
be reconfigured by just editing a text file. Any operating system
which supports the FAT file system can be used to make changes to the
configuration of the boot loader.

</para><para>

To put <command>SYSLINUX</command> on the FAT16 partition on your USB
stick, install the <classname>syslinux</classname> and
<classname>mtools</classname> packages on your system, and type

<informalexample><screen>

syslinux /dev/<replaceable>sda1</replaceable>

</screen></informalexample>

Again, take care that you use the correct device name. The partition
must not be mounted when starting <command>SYSLINUX</command>. This
procedure writes a boot sector to the partition and creates the file
<filename>ldlinux.sys</filename> which contains the boot loader code.

</para><para>

Mount the partition (<userinput>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt</userinput>) and
copy the following files from the Ubuntu archives to the stick:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>

<filename>vmlinuz</filename> (kernel binary)

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

<filename>initrd.gz</filename> (initial ramdisk image)

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

<filename>syslinux.cfg</filename> (SYSLINUX configuration file)

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Optional kernel modules

</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

If you want to rename the files, please note that
<command>SYSLINUX</command> can only process DOS (8.3) file names.

</para><para>

The <filename>syslinux.cfg</filename> configuration file should
contain the following two lines:

<informalexample><screen>

default vmlinuz
append initrd=initrd.gz ramdisk_size=10000 root=/dev/rd/0 init=/linuxrc devfs=mount,dall rw

</screen></informalexample>

Please note, that the <userinput>ramdisk_size</userinput> parameter
may need to be increased, depending on the image you are booting.

</para><para>

If you are using the <filename>hd-media</filename> image, you should
now put any Ubuntu ISO image onto your stick (if it fits).
The file name of such an
image must end in <filename>.iso</filename>.

</para><para>

If you want to install over the network, without using an ISO image,
you will of course skip the previous step. Moreover you will have to
use the initial ramdisk from the <filename>netboot</filename>
directory instead of the one from <filename>hd-media</filename>,
because <filename>hd-media/initrd.gz</filename> does not have network
support.

</para><para>

When you are done, unmount the USB memory stick (<userinput>umount
/mnt</userinput>) and activate its write protection switch.

</para><warning><para>

If your system refuses to boot from the memory stick, the stick may
contain an invalid master boot record (MBR). To fix this, use the
<command>install-mbr</command> command from the package
<classname>mbr</classname>:

<informalexample><screen>

install-mbr /dev/<replaceable>sda</replaceable>

</screen></informalexample>
