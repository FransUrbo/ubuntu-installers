0fAvailable boot methods:07

0flinux07
  Start the installation -- this is the default ${MEDIA_TYPE} install.
0fexpert07
  Start the installation in expert mode, for maximum control.
0fcustom07, 0fcustom-expert07
  Minimal system install. Recommended for servers, where the system
  administrator will install custom software, and where a complete
  graphical desktop environment is not desired.

To use one of these boot methods, type it at the prompt, optionally
followed by any boot parameters. For example:

  boot: linux acpi=off

If unsure, you should use the default boot method, with no special
parameters, by simply pressing enter at the boot prompt.
